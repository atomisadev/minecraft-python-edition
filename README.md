This is a Minecraft version I built using OpenGL and Python. I used C bindings using `ctypes` in order to make my code applicable to as many languages possible (and to challenge myself).

## Installation
To be quite honest, I don't know why any sane person would install this, but if you would like to, here is how:
1. Clone the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:atomisadev/minecraft-python-edition.git ./
```

2. If you haven't already, `cd` into the directory. The command above creates it in the directory you're currently in, so no need to.
3. Install the dependencies

```
pip install --user pyglet nbtlib base36 pyglm
```

4. Run the code. `cd` into the main directory including all the files, and run the following command.

```
python3 main.py
```

5. It will launch a window with the "game."

## How does it work?
**Coming soon** (once I'm done making it)

## Contributing
No sane person would contribute to this repository, and I don't think you should either.
